# BreastCancerData

This is a personal project using breast cancer data to predict binary responses using two different methods to measure accuracy of the algorithms.
The two algorithms of choice for this particular data set were SVM and Grid Search
As you can see from the results grid search provides a higher accuracy of 0.97 whereas SVM is around 0.96, although Grid Search taking a substantial more amount of time.
